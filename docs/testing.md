# Tests and their boundaries

## Run with CMake/CTest

Requirements: CMake 3.20+, Python 3.8+, Clang/AppleClang with AddressSanitizer and
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and a native macOS or Linux environment. No Python
third-party packages, old Windows SDKs, `homes.zip`, or network access are needed
to run these tests once the toolchain is installed.

From the repository root:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure --parallel 2
```

Alternatively, `cmake --build build --target check` runs the same suite.
Each C++ regression script compiles its own temporary harness during the test;
there is no separate native engine/application build target yet. CMake checks
the compiler and sanitizer link support during configuration. CTest runs the
scripts using that selected compiler, overriding an inherited `CXX` variable.
Pass compiler options through the harnesses when changing them deliberately;
these scripts do not inherit arbitrary CMake build-type or compiler flags.

To run just the DSP tests or the documentation check:

```sh
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L dsp
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure -L docs
```

The direct runner remains available:

```sh
python3 tests/regression/run_all.py
```

It uses `clang++` by default; `CXX` may name a Clang executable (not a command
with flags). For documentation only, run
`python3 tests/regression/documentation_regressions.py`; no compiler is needed.

The GitHub Actions workflow runs the CMake/CTest entry point on macOS and Linux.
Adding a workflow file does not establish that its remote jobs have passed.

## Current coverage

The tests below use the canonical `convolver/` source tree. Earlier local
`tests/*.py` experiments aimed at a separate source snapshot are not the gate.

| Suite | What it establishes | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | 444 checks against independent double time-domain convolution; partition padding, routing/delays, chunks/reset, complex arithmetic | Actual DSP bodies with portable DFT and platform/file stubs; not real FFTW |
| Host adapters | 44 debug/release cases; narrow PCM, aliases, additive/double output, disconnected inputs/delay history | Actual extracted sample adapters; Boost conversion boundary substituted; not a loaded plug-in |
| Gain | Two unequal route-count cases | Extracted gain routines |
| Branch regressions | Route signs, list display, dither constants, bundled Ooura full/tail round trips | Serial Ooura arithmetic, not the full alternate-backend engine |
| Historical diagnostics | Eight stream-state cases | Extracted diagnostic clauses, not complete parser fuzzing |
| Historical I/O | 32 debug/release cases plus legacy syntax/disabled-library checks | Actual wrapper/table code with mocked libsndfile; no codec or real file-descriptor integration |
| Pipe | 274 argument, failure and EOF accounting checks | Actual entry point/helpers with stream/engine stubs |
| Pipe DSP | 100 end-of-stream cases against direct convolution | Actual convolution bodies with DFT adapter; not real stdin/codecs |
| Documentation | 99 archived file sizes/hashes, 18-page inventory, local links/fragments, saved audit consistency | Offline preservation check; does not re-fetch the live website or external URLs |

All eight C++ suites enable ASan and UBSan with sanitizer failures fatal.
Some extraction adapters repair old compiler syntax or replace platform
boundaries. These are useful regression checks for reviewed behaviour, not proof
that unmodified production translation units compile on a modern toolchain.

The documentation checker also exercises seven failure cases on temporary
fixtures: changed bytes, changed size, missing file, missing link target, missing
fragment, and escaping manifest/link paths. Original archived bytes remain
unchanged. The independently enumerated pages and saved manifest detect loss;
the live-site comparison is a dated provenance record, not a network CI test.

## Gates for a native release

The next essential step is to run the numerical fixtures through a **normally
compiled production core linked to real FFT libraries**, and to exercise real
libsndfile file/pipe I/O. Add every backend to the same contract tests. Retain the
independent direct-convolution oracle rather than relying only on agreement
between FFT implementations.

Outstanding cases include full-width PCM32 saturation, nonzero noise shaping,
CMD EOF/tail handling, actual host format negotiation and latency/tail reporting,
malformed configuration/IR fuzzing, multi-instance/filter-switch behaviour, and
callback allocation/deadline measurements. The portable CTest gate does not
establish native Windows/ATL/DirectShow/VST compatibility or real-time safety.

The [modernization plan](modernization.md) defines the backend, native-platform,
file/pipe, lifecycle and performance acceptance criteria. Add native production
tests beside the existing regressions as each component becomes portable; only
retire extraction harnesses once their failure cases are covered there.
