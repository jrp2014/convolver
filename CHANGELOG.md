# Changelog

Changes to the portable C++ core, CLI and plug-ins. The portable package is
versioned separately from the historical Windows releases (1.x to 4.4), whose
release notes are archived in [docs/historical](docs/historical).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Until 1.0 the C++ API may change between minor versions.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added
- Configuration compatibility corpus (`tests/compatibility/`): generated
  fixtures rendered through the CLI and checked against an independent
  direct-convolution reference at several block sizes and both latency modes.
- `convolver --inspect` and `convolver --validate`, with `--json` (report
  schema 1), `--syntax-only`, `--all-configurations`, `--sample-rate`,
  `--input-channels` and `--warnings-as-errors`.
- `convolver::inspect_configuration` (`convolver/inspection.hpp`, in
  `Convolver::io`) and `convolver::analyze_configuration` (core).
- `--profile portable-paths` (`InspectionProfile::portable_paths`): warnings
  for absolute references, references leaving the configuration's folder,
  letter-case differences from the names on disk, and names Windows cannot
  store. `docs/configuration-compatibility.md` records the evidence for each
  accepted feature and what is known about other readers of the format.
- A diagnostic for configurations in the format before 3.0 (no delay lines)
  that says which lines to add.
- Boundary tests for every configuration, list, IR and host-state limit
  (`native.limits`), and libFuzzer harnesses for configuration text, lists,
  host state and IR files (`tests/fuzz/`, `-DCONVOLVER_BUILD_FUZZERS=ON` with
  Clang). Committed seeds and regression inputs replay on every compiler as
  `fuzz.replay.*`; CI fuzzes each target for 60 seconds.
- `--speaker-map config` labels WAV output channels with the configuration's
  hex channel mask (WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE), and `OutputMetadata` is an optional
  fourth `AudioWriter` argument. Masks must name one known speaker per output
  channel; samples keep their order. Without the flag output is unchanged.
- `AudioReader::declared_frames()`: the frame count a file header declares.
- Two new resolution limits: 16 MiB of configuration text read per load or
  inspection, and 256 inspection diagnostics followed by one
  `diagnostics-truncated` warning.

### Changed
- Configuration errors report the file, physical line and column, and the
  chain of enclosing lists. Rejected Windows drive, UNC and rooted paths name
  an existing relative replacement when one is found beside the configuration.
- `Convolver::io` now links `Convolver::core`. The package version is 0.3.0;
  consumers ask for `find_package(Convolver 0.3 ...)`.
- The configuration parser is separated from list resolution and IR decoding
  (`portable/config_parse.*`, private). Selection and rendered audio are
  unchanged, and so are accepted configurations, except that lists reading more
  than 16 MiB of configuration text in one load are now rejected (see Added).

### Fixed
- An IR whose header declares more than 64 Mi samples is rejected before any
  sample is read, instead of after decoding up to the limit.
- An audio file with an out-of-range sample rate or channel count in its header
  is reported as an unreadable file. Previously the exception escaped
  inspection and list traversal (found by fuzzing).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added
- Portable host lifecycle (`Convolver::host`) and a VST3 adapter built against
  VST3 SDK 3.8.1, with adapter, preset and SDK validator tests in CI.
- Documented streaming contract for hosts.
- FFT backend notes and benchmarks (`docs/fft-backends.md`, `docs/benchmarks/`):
  FFTW build flags, planner modes, and packaging gaps on Apple Silicon and vcpkg.

### Changed
- Filter and history spectra are stored split per partition (real parts, then
  imaginary parts) so the multiply-accumulate vectorises. Output is unchanged;
  long filters run 1.15 to 1.3 times faster on x86-64.
- Windows CI builds FFTW with SSE2, AVX and AVX2.
- Windows VST3 builds link FFTW statically so hosts can load the plug-in.
- VST3 factory and macOS bundle versions now come from the CMake project version.
- The package version check accepts only matching minor versions, so consumers
  must now ask for `find_package(Convolver 0.2 ...)`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added
- Portable C++20 convolution core with FFTW and Apple Accelerate backends,
  FFTW wisdom support, and a libsndfile command-line tool.
- `.cfg` reader compatible with the historical Convolver format.
- CMake package exports (`Convolver::core`, `Convolver::io`), presets, and
  native oracle, sanitizer and historical regression tests on Linux, macOS and
  Windows.

### Fixed
- Windows FFTW DLL data imports, RAW pipe end-of-file handling, and portable
  documentation and config paths.
