# Changelog

Changes to the portable C++ core, CLI and plug-ins. The portable package is
versioned separately from the historical Windows releases (1.x to 4.4), whose
release notes are archived in [docs/historical](docs/historical).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Until 1.0 the C++ API may change between minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Automatic patch versions and annotated source tags on `main`, with one
  `VERSION` file shared by the CMake package, CLI and VST3 bundle.
- CLI and VST3 factory build identification including the Git revision and a
  marker for uncommitted changes. See [source versioning](docs/versioning.md).
- PCM16 dither. `Pcm16Quantizer` and `QuantizationOptions` define a deterministic,
  seeded policy with `none`, `rectangular`, `triangular` (TPDF) and
  `triangular_highpass` (the historical engine's "Triangular") modes.
  CLI options `--dither` and `--dither-seed`; dither is off unless requested.
- The benchmark reports p50, p99 and maximum single-block times and peak memory,
  and has two 6×6 matrix cases.

### Changed

- Paths with identical ordered input routes share one forward FFT and spectrum
  history. Output is bit-identical; dense routing matrices run 1.2 to 1.4 times
  faster and use less memory.
- PCM16 output rounds to nearest. libsndfile 1.2.2's float-to-PCM16 conversion
  with clipping enabled rounds down, which added a -0.5 LSB bias.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- Portable host lifecycle (`Convolver::host`) and a VST3 adapter built against
  VST3 SDK 3.8.1, with adapter, preset and SDK validator tests in CI.
- Documented streaming contract for hosts.
- FFT backend notes and benchmarks (`docs/fft-backends.md`, `docs/benchmarks/`):
  FFTW build flags, planner modes, and packaging gaps on Apple Silicon and vcpkg.

### Changed

- Filter and history spectra are stored split per partition (real parts, then
  imaginary parts) so the multiply-accumulate vectorises. Output is unchanged;
  long filters run 1.15 to 1.3 times faster on x86-64.
- Windows CI builds FFTW with SSE2, AVX and AVX2.
- Windows VST3 builds link FFTW statically so hosts can load the plug-in.
- VST3 factory and macOS bundle versions now come from the CMake project version.
- The package version check accepts only matching minor versions, so consumers
  must now ask for `find_package(Convolver 0.2 ...)`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- Portable C++20 convolution core with FFTW and Apple Accelerate backends,
  FFTW wisdom support, and a libsndfile command-line tool.
- `.cfg` reader compatible with the historical Convolver format.
- CMake package exports (`Convolver::core`, `Convolver::io`), presets, and
  native oracle, sanitizer and historical regression tests on Linux, macOS and
  Windows.

### Fixed

- Windows FFTW DLL data imports, RAW pipe end-of-file handling, and portable
  documentation and config paths.
